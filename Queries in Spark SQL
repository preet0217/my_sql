For this assignment, we'll be using a new dataset: the SF Fire Incident dataset. It has been mounted for you using the script above. The path to this dataset is as follows:

/mnt/davis/fire-incidents/fire-incidents-2016.csv

In this assignment, you will read the dataset and perform a number of different queries.

Create a new table called fireIncidents for this dataset. Be sure to use options to properly parse the data.

%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup

%fs head /mnt/davis/fire-incidents/fire-incidents-2016.csv %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup


CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Databricks
USE Databricks

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fireincidents;


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fireincidents
USING CSV
OPTIONS(
        header "true",
        path "/mnt/davis/fire-incidents/fire-incidents-2016.csv",
        inferSchema "true")


SELECT * FROM fireincidents LIMIT 10

Question 1

Return the first 10 lines of the data. On the Coursera platform, input the result to the following question:

What is the first value for "Incident Number"?

      SELECT * FROM fireincidents LIMIT 10

16000003


Question 2

Return all incidents that occurred on Conor's birthday in 2016. For those of you who forgot his birthday, it's April 4th. On the Coursera platform, input the result to the following question:

What is the first value for "Incident Number" on April 4th, 2016?

**Remember to use backticks (``) instead of single quotes ('') for columns that have spaces in the name. **


SELECT `Incident Number` as inc_num
FROM fireincidents
WHERE `Incident Date`= '04/04/2016'


Question 3

Return all incidents that occurred on Conor's or Brooke's birthday. For those of you who forgot her birthday too, it's 9/27.

Is the first fire call in this table on Brooke or Conor's birthday?


SELECT `Incident Number` as inc_num
FROM fireincidents
WHERE `Incident Date`= '04/04/2016'
  OR `Incident Date`= '27/09/2016'

Question 4

Return all incidents on either Conor or Brooke's birthday where the Station Area is greater than 20.

What is the "Station Area" for the first fire call in this table?


SELECT stn

FROM        
        (SELECT `Incident Number` as inc_num, `Incident Date` as date,`Station Area` as stn
        FROM fireincidents
        WHERE `Incident Date`= '04/04/2016'
           OR 
              `Incident Date`= '27/09/2016')incidents
WHERE incidents.stn>20


Question 5

Count the incidents on Conor's birthday.

How many incidents were on Conor's birthday in 2016?
80

SELECT SUM(count)

FROM     
     (SELECT COUNT(1) as count
     FROM fireincidents
     WHERE `Incident Date`= '04/04/2016'
     GROUP BY `Incident Number`)incidents


Question 6

Return the total counts by Ignition Cause. Be sure to return the field Ignition Cause as well.

Hint Hint: You'll have to use GROUP BY for this

How many fire calls had an "Ignition Cause" of "4 act of nature"?



SELECT  `Ignition Cause`,COUNT (`Ignition Cause`) as total

FROM fireincidents

GROUP BY  `Ignition Cause`
ORDER BY total

Question 7

Return the total counts by Ignition Cause sorted in ascending order.

Hint Hint: You'll have to use ORDER BY for this.

What is the most common "Ignition Cause"? (Put the entire string)

SELECT  `Ignition Cause`,COUNT (`Ignition Cause`) as total

FROM fireincidents

GROUP BY  `Ignition Cause`
ORDER BY total DESC

Return the total counts by `Ignition Cause` sorted in descending order.

SELECT SUM(count_1)

FROM    
    (SELECT  `Ignition Cause`,
              COUNT (`Ignition Cause`) as count_1
    
    FROM fireincidents
    
    GROUP BY  `Ignition Cause`
    ORDER BY count_1
    )tot  


Create the table `fireCalls` if it doesn't already exist.  The path is as follows: `/mnt/davis/fire-calls/fire-calls-truncated-comma.csv`

SELECT * FROM fireCalls LIMIT 10
Join the two tables on Battalion by performing an inner join.
SELECT *
FROM 
    fireincidents
INNER JOIN
    fireCalls
ON
  fireincidents.Battalion=fireCalls.Battalion


Question 8

Count the total incidents from the two tables joined on Battalion.

What is the total incidents from the two joined tables?
847094402
SELECT 
          COUNT(fireincidents.`incident number`)
              
        FROM 
            fireincidents
        INNER JOIN
            fireCalls
        ON
          fireincidents.Battalion=fireCalls.Battalion
